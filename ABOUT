<center><i><font face="Comic Scans MS" size="4" color="Red">I created this website for personal use only. <br>
I am Alexis John Blake Catalan. 19 years of age.<br>
Currently Studying in Kolehiyo ng Lungsod ng Lipa. <br>
As you can see my course is Bachelor in Science and Computer Science.<br>
Im a future programmer so I say, <br>
that's why I must pursue this dream even though there's struggle<br>
I will definitely do it because<br>
I want to prove to myself and family that I have what it takes to be a better man.<br>
Im currently designing this website for my final exam even <br>
though I don't have much knowledge about it im trying to do my best.<br>
I would take this chance to introduce myself a little.<br>
I am not rich nor poor,<br>
My family is one of the type of families that can provide food 3 times a day.<br>  	
Sometimes I also experience the struggle of thinking of quiting school <br>
because of finacial problems but<br>
I made it here because of the people who was helping me.<br>
Thank's to those people I made through in those problems.<br>
That's why I must work hard to make them proud,<br>
To make them happy,<br>
To make them not regret the things that they have given to me. <br>
I have a long way to go but I will not promise it,<br>
I will do it.<br>
So I excuse myself for a while,I wish to see you again someday.<br>
Thank you for Reading!! I Hope you Like it!! :)<br>
